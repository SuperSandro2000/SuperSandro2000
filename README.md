### Hey :wave:

- :telescope: I am currently spending most of my free time on [nixpkgs and NixOS](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/) and contributing to all kinds of other open source software fixing small issues here and there I encounter almost daily.
- :mailbox: Reach me over the links in the left sidebar on [my website](https://supersandro.de/).
- :hammer_and_wrench: If you would like to have a review or merge in nixpkgs feel free to drop me a message.
