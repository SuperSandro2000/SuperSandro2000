### Hey :wave:

- :telescope: I am currently spending most of my free time on [nixpkgs and NixOS](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/) and spend little time to maintain [ddclient](https://github.com/ddclient/ddclient/) and [factorio-docker](https://github.com/factoriotools/factorio-docker/).
- :briefcase: I am no longer looking for a job.
- :mailbox: Reach me over the links in the left sidebar on [my website](https://supersandro.de/).
- :hammer_and_wrench: If you would like to have a review or merge in nixpkgs feel free to drop me a message.
- :zap: Fun fact: I archived all Factorio mods. One went missing? Reach out to me and I might have a copy of it.
